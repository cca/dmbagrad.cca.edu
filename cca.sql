Each scenario is a different version of what architectural practices could look like in 2030, and none is intended to be seen as better or worse than the others. They are all meant to be plausible futures with both more desirable and less desirable outcomes. \n\nIn Strategic Foresight, scenarios are used as decision making tools. They are a way of developing alternative futures based on a combination of different assumptions, signals, trends, and drivers. Scenarios allow stakeholders to immerse themselves in future worlds, making the conceptual more tangible and less daunting. Through the presentation of various scenarios, stakeholders are better informed of options and possibilities and are better positioned to make decisions in a more timely manner.\nWhy the Future of Architecture?\n\nAs a young architectural professional who on the cusp of venturing out into my own practice, I realized that aside from the logistic of running my own studio, what I found more troubling was deciding how the studio should approach design and who our targeted clients would be. Beyond this, how would I ensure that the projects designed would not be of benefit only to my direct client, but that they would also serve the greater good.\n\nI see More than Buildings: the Future of Architecture 2030 as an opportunity to explore the different trajectories a small practice may face in the near future, and the implications resulting from the distinct approaches and attitudes toward design.','https://vault.cca.edu/items/93d62450-c818-4b69-825b-395f51948d1a/1/','Leticia Murray','Spring 2016','Foresight Venture Studio','Leland Shupp','SFMBA-608-01',NULL,0),('strategicForesight','leeshupp','2016-07-12T14:44:46.424-07:00','85dc719f-2e16-4115-993c-36aa312f9497','SFMBA-608',165,'ASPIRE - Strategic Foresight Capstone Project ','The thesis project will explore in depth, potentially via causal layered analysis (CLA) the following trajectory of change:  Due in part to the accelerating evolution and integration of technology, and subsequent impact(s) (e.g. symptoms not unlike Toffler’s “Future Shock”) on work, employment, and human productivity, a growing number of people are grappling with significant changes (in some cases disruption) within in their current job or profession.  These changes are causing people to explore new ways to reinvent themselves and adapt in order to find new stability within the job market, or compatibility within an entirely new professional context.  This process involves re-examining their values and answering some fundamental questions, including: who they are, what is important and meaningful to them, how they think about and create value, and what they want to do versus what they are capable of.  People are using a broad spectrum of tools, tactics, and coping mechanisms that span job hunting, entrepreneurship, networking, career coaching, self help, skills acquisition, education, and in extreme cases, counseling and medical treatment. \n\nWhen faced with a significant change in their job or career, most people shift a great deal of their attention to the future.  What do they want? What is really important to them?  In general, when formulating answers to these questions most people determine that they want to lead more fulfilling and meaningful lives.  So they begin to envision a variety of possible futures – potential bright spots on their horizon -- that align with their values (e.g. who they want to be) and enable them to feel good about themselves, happy (or at least OK) with where they are now, and empowered about the changes, challenges, and adaptation they face. \n\nThese people are actively seeking ways to move towards a future they want and believe in – their preferred future. But in many cases, who they want to be and what they want to do (their preferred future) is not available to them because it is based on what they see as their “potential,’ NOT their existing capabilities or capacity.  As a result, more often than not, people do not possess the wherewithal (e.g. the skills, experience, actionable steps, relationships, resources etc. etc.) required to realize their potential, and manifest a preferred future.  Subsequently, they are forced to re-define themselves and their future based on what they have or have not done in their past. \n\nASPIRE is a solution that enables people in transition to live into their potential (not their past), and actualize a preferred future. ASPIRE enables people to connect and collaborate to co-create a more meaningful “today” that moves them towards a “tomorrow” they want and believe in. \n\n•	Helps people define and share a “preferred future” in a purposeful network environment\n•	Generates and preserves a navigable/actionable “possibility path” to a preferred future\n•	Enables a “citizenry” to connect, collaborate, and co-create along their possibility paths \n•	Enables people to earn and deliver specific value (verified skills, experience, and relationships acquired in the past) that helps others progress along their possibility path to their preferred future\n\n','https://vault.cca.edu/items/85dc719f-2e16-4115-993c-36aa312f9497/1/','Jonjozuf Hadley','Spring 2016','Foresight Venture Studio','Leland Shupp','SFMBA-608-01',NULL,0),('strategicForesight','leeshupp','2016-07-12T14:44:14.477-07:00','3d850173-cd77-4e58-a5e3-0f8f0bc547d6','SFMBA-608',166,'Transhumanism in four scenarios','The scope of the research is to provide alternate future scenarios for considering the unintended consequences of the deliberate modification of the human species.

Created by friends for friends.\n\nSimply, Mosey is a web app that allows you to create and give your favorite experiences in your town to your friends. Be it four hours or a weekend—by using Google maps and places, Mosey gives you a delightful environment to search, drag-and- drop activities and locations to create a rich linear timeline, guiding a friend through a custom adventure.\n\nOur initial insight was based on a common experience that we all have. As residents of interesting cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York, we commonly have friends from out of town call or email with the question “Hey, I’m coming to your town! What should I do?” Mosey just reinvented your response.\n\nWe wanted to package that dilemma up into a delightfully simple solution that allows you to easily create and gift a custom experience. Your friend then opens it on their smart phone, navigating step by step, place by place—guided only by the journey you built for them. And all complete with notations on “that” bar’s best cocktail, or “this” park’s shady patch for a mid-day nap.\n\nHow can Mosey evolve? Picture traveling to NYC and the hotel concierge uses your Mosey profile or asks you a few questions, then uses Mosey to plan a custom experience in New York just for you. Or even better, when renting an apartment in Paris through Airbnb, the homeowner leaves you a journey through her neighborhood for a morning, equipped with shop owner names, hidden pathways and the perfect Parisian book store. Rather than getting suggestions from unreliable strangers like Yelp, or lists of recommended spots like many other services, Mosey is one friend building the perfect experience for another ... and we think that has magic.\n\nMosey.

Currently in the U.S., channels for imperfect and surplus foods are almost non-existent.\n\nWunderfood focuses on 3 types of farmer to buyer waste: 1) Surplus – excess beyond the market demand 2) Imperfect – cosmetically ugly, misshapen or mis-sized, 3) Rejected orders – food rejected by a food buyer sent back to the farmer.

Over the last decade, a vast number of technologies, tools, and services have been made available to musicians to help them do the jobs that record labels used to do for only a small fraction of artists. Today, more than 4 million independent musicians have the tools to record, produce, promote, and distribute their own music. This group is spending $4.5 billion on music production each year, but most of the time they end up paying too much for expensive studio infrastructure, waste time with an ill-suited producer, spend countless hours learning how to mix and master themselves, or forego music production entirely. Further complicating matters, the non-creative jobs on musicians’ plates take away from the time they want to dedicate to creating, performing, and collaborating. Fulfilling the creative dream is possible, but the process is disorganized and full of distractions. \n\nAt the same time, the technologies and tools that enable musicians have also empowered freelance engineers that want to be a part of music creation. Affordable music production tools have moved mixing and mastering from big recording studios into engineers’ living rooms and bedrooms. No longer beholden to the big studios, freelance engineers want to produce music but have no good way to promote themselves or find the musicians that are looking for their help.

No one is effectively meeting the needs of the curious cannabis consumers— parents, professionals and others who are interested in trying these products but are intimidated by the current cannabis industry, catered towards more intense and habitual users. These new-to-the-market consumers want something for their specific needs, and they want convenience, control and reliability. Additionally, growers and producers, in order to stay competitive, need reliable and specific data about their products to be able to target these particular consumers and make their product more predictable. They are eager to get reliable data on these consumers and are willing to pay for insights into their preferences and purchasing choices.\n\nIn order to address these needs, MARI provides simple, controllable and curated cannabis experiences through a subscription box to consumers and collects key data via feedback forms for producers. We provide curious cannabis consumers with an integrated, individualized, convenient, and highly curated cannabis consumption experience. We do this through an online subscription service that ships low-THC cannabis oil varietals to users every month. MARI screens our products for consistency and purported effects, like  sleepiness, energy, euphoria, or relaxation, and deliver a collection that serves the needs of each customer. All our varietals are low dose to offer users the peace of mind of a controlled experience, like that of a glass or two of wine. We also understand our target users’ desire to consume cannabis in a discreet manner. This is why we only offer cannabis oil, which can only be consumed using a small vaporizer pen—no smoke and no smell. \n\nAs our customers engage with our product, they will provide feedback in the form of reviews, some of which will be available to other customers. Customers will have the option to share reviews exclusively with MARI or also share them publicly on the online platform.

Programs working to rehabilitate aren’t properly self-assessing and a majority lack fundraising capacity. They also have limited knowledge sharing and the ability to learn from others to redesign programs for scale and greater effectiveness. Funders have limited visibility into a program’s impact and as a result see social investments as risky. \n\nThe Opportunity\nBeyond Bars focuses at the system level of recidivism efforts to connect funders with service providers so funds are channelled to the most effective programs. This in turn motivates programs, as a whole, to adopt an approach which directly translates into sustainable funding, and therefore creates a steady downward trend in recidivism. Presently, no centralized database of the organizations working in social impact exists. Nor is there a shared platform of communication on which these Service Providers and potential Funders can connect. \n\nThe Market\nThe US Department of Justice requested 95.3 million for prevention and reentry efforts with $56.5 million being allocated to grants. More broadly giving by foundations amounted to $53.7 billion in 2013 and of that total amount 12% went to human services and grant making entities according to Giving USA. Open Society Foundations allocates 6% of their total 2016 of 930.7M budget towards Justice Reform and The Rule of Law programs. Beyond Bars estimates foundational giving to recidivism organizations at $386 million (6%*12%*53.7B) although the ability to demonstrate most effective correctional strategies through data remains undone. \n\nThe Concept\nBeyond Bars plans to be a for profit benefit corporation that incentivizes service providers to measure their impact by connecting them with foundations looking to fund programs making a difference. We expect to reach $8.8 million in annual revenue in year 5 by charging funders and programs an annual subscription fee to access impact data. After establishing this vertical, Beyond Bars plans to expand to other social problems where funders need impact measurements to drive accountability and transparency. By prompting and facilitating ongoing communication between Funders and ‘Top-Rated’ Service Providers, we can transform beyond a mere static database into a dynamic, evolving platform, through which the critical players channel available funds to organizations doing effective work in the recidivism space.

Building on the momentum of the currently exploding food delivery space, we will — as a baseline — provide the convenience of fresh dinner ingredients without the hassle of grocery shopping. However, what truly distinguishes us is our rich emphasis on cooking education: each meal is part of a program, tailored specifically to one’s skill level and objectives, which is professionally designed to improve culinary skills and develop the confidence every chef needs to own the kitchen for life. \n\nThere is a clear and growing demand for convenient ingredient delivery. There is likewise a strong generational desire to improve one’s cooking skills and, furthermore, a need — bodily, environmental, financial — to encourage at-home cooking. While there are traditional avenues available for improving one’s culinary skills, these options are either too formal/ expensive/ niche (cooking schools like CIA or Cordon Bleu) or too informal/DIY/dispersed (Epicurious, YouTube tutorials, online classes). We want to be somewhere in the middle combining the best of both worlds and believe there is a significant market opportunity available to a company that combines the convenience of ingredient delivery with the enrichment of self-improvement in the kitchen. \n\nThe Cookery will phase its strategy into five parts, all related to the stages of development of the business. \nStage 1: Build a stronghold within major urban markets, evolving into a household name for a “cooking school at home”.  This involves curating limited packages with reliable delivery.  \nStage 2: Create and deliver a learn to cook program that can be integrated into the training program for both cooking schools and restaurants.  This involves understanding how to complement and not compete against existing educational environments.  \nStage 3: Expand from urban areas into suburban spaces, effectively expanding the total addressable market.

As cities continue to grow, it is evident that certain urban mechanisms need to evolve as well. Such is the case with rental housing in cities where the market is particularly competitive.\n	\nBoth prospective tenants and landlords are faced with a number of pain points along their journeys: an exhaustive application and evaluation process that must factor a plethora of personal selection criteria and important information exchanges. This transaction is arduous and tedious, and is often a source of great anxiety for many.\n\nOur team imagines a simpler and friendlier rental process, from searching and listing to move in. In particular, we wish to standardize and “humanize” the rental application process, so that renters can better communicate who they are, beyond numbers on a page. Similarly, we wish to make it easier for landlords to evaluate prospective tenants against a variety of non-financial dimensions, including personality, integrity, and cultural fit.\n\nAt a high level, the rental housing application process has not evolved. We wish to raise the bar in the industry by making this process fun, intuitive, rewarding, and accessible.

As Sift gets to know you, we can even suggest linkages between your content to help you make better sense of them.','https://vault.cca.edu/items/16e47a9f-ae25-48cd-9a3c-6a2dbe5ff038/1/','Erica Meade, Nicole Chen','Spring 2010','Venture Studio','Bill Wurz, Asher Waldfogel','DSMBA-608-01',NULL,0),('designStartegy',NULL,'2015-03-17T16:25:09.607-07:00','141fe5f3-9411-434d-94e8-2eaf2cb40ba0','DSMBA-608',218,'The Green Exchange','In today’s competitive medical cannabis market, an independent grower stands alone against the competition. At the same time, patients do not have consistent access to high-quality varietals because of the lack of supply chain management and quality grading. These current operational problems will only be exacerbated by the increase in growers and suppliers that would likely accompany legalization. In 1893, a similarly disorganized supply chain led to the development of the large orange grower cooperative, SunKist. Like SunKist, we’ve created the Green Exchange— a centralized ordering, grading, and delivery system— to replace the chaotic process of individual growers selling to individual retail outlets.\n\nOur core offering is an online brokerage that intelligently matches buyers and sellers to create a more\nefficient supply chain for the industry. The Green Exchange’s safe, secure website utillizes a visual interface that presents the analytics and matching system in an approachable, user-friendly way. Each transaction is accompanied by an on-site inspection process that uses DNA testing to verify and grade the cannabis variety being sold. After testing, the product is sorted, packaged, sealed with a holographic security sticker, and then delivered to an assigned buyer. Both parties pay a service fee based on the transaction price.\n\nPackaging- Packaging was designed for security purposes, quality control, and to differentiate between the two strains of cannabis, indica and sativa.\nWebsite -The Green Exchange portal was designed to meet the needs of both dispensaries and growers.','https://vault.cca.edu/items/141fe5f3-9411-434d-94e8-2eaf2cb40ba0/1/','Henry Liu, Kathryn Hautanen, Mattia Nuzzo, Vinitha Watson','Spring 2010','Venture Studio','Bill Wurz, Asher Waldfogel','DSMBA-608-01',NULL,0),('designStartegy',NULL,'2015-03-17T12:52:02.420-07:00','107daa0a-1134-42a7-b9d5-0401650bcb37','DSMBA-608',219,'Institute for Relaxed Living','Parity, Participation, Progress\n\nA year long investigation into the unmet needs of working parents uncovered an overwhelming majority of both sexes who believe the structure of modern workplace has compromised the role of family and social capital overall. A third place between work and home, our venture project proposed a co-op dedicated to serving the needs of the family. Starting with a pre-school—a natural transition point in many families lives---through a physical meeting place where families can gather to an online concierge service that can help find a plumber or a tax accountant, we proposed pooling spending to capture more value from the approximately $3 trillion that women spend predominately on their families.\n\nOur financial model suggested that with starting with 150 families in year 1 we’d be able to staff and run the operations with nearly $2.5 M in profit within 5 years.','https://vault.cca.edu/items/107daa0a-1134-42a7-b9d5-0401650bcb37/1/','Beth Berrean, Erica Frye, Heike Rapp-Wurm','Spring 2010','Venture Studio','Bill Wurz, Asher Waldfogel','DSMBA-608-01',NULL,0),('designStartegy',NULL,'2015-03-17T12:38:27.745-07:00','380d88e7-3a2d-47b4-ac70-9f4b7de1666f','DSMBA-608',220,'Hearphile','Hearphile is not just another website hawking hearing aid batteries. It seeks to build a hearing appreciation\nmovement. Hearphile is an online gathering place for hearing loss professionals and consumers. A space\nwhere individuals can find answers to protect the hearing they have, correct the hearing they’re losing, and\nconnect with others in the hearing loss community.\n\nIt is estimated that 22 million people could benefit from wearing hearing aids, yet only 20% of them do. In her prior research Kate found that resistance to purchasing hearing aids comes from cultural stigma, high price point and according to Consumer Reports, “a fragmented and confusing marketplace.” And yet the potential audience for hearing aids is booming: tech-savvy baby boomers are getting older, iPods are damaging younger people’s hearing and the number one disability returning veterans report is hearing loss.\n\nThe industry continues to market primarily through the outdated method of placing brochures in doctor’s offices, sometimes offering these same brochures as a PDF online. Hearing aids are expensive, yet unlike digital cameras and home theater systems there are no objective online resources for consumers to educate themselves. Using current best practices, we developed Hearphile as a website for consumers to understand their hearing loss, find asolution and meet other users for support.\n\nMobile App- An audiogram in the palm of your hand makes it simple to understand your hearing\nthreshold, reference your audiogram history and track adjustments to your hearing aids','https://vault.cca.edu/items/380d88e7-3a2d-47b4-ac70-9f4b7de1666f/1/','Kate Ranson-Walsh, Tim Bishop','Spring 2010','Venture Studio','Bill Wurz, Asher Waldfogel','DSMBA-608-01',NULL,0),('designStartegy',NULL,'2015-03-17T12:26:31.066-07:00','bc0e29e6-b512-4eaa-a1f0-5256742554e3','DSMBA-608',221,'goProto','Prototyping is one of design’s most powerful tools. Testing prototypes allows you to generate real data to aid decision making, instead of just guessing at potential outcomes. goProto is a platform for individuals, teams, start-ups and even mature companies to collaborate, solicit feedback and expertise, and test prototypes with real people in order to transform ideas into meaningful solutions. It’s a place to get your ideas dirty.\n\nWe started our venture project with a simple goal: empower people to realize their ideas. We’re excited about making things happen, and we’re not alone. The last decade has seen tremendous growth in creativity, collaboration and online communities. In fact, 60% of Americans use social media, and of those, 59% interact with businesses on social networks. For example, Quirky, a collaborative product  development site, was recently awarded $6 million in Series A funding and there are now over 150,000 iPhone apps in Apple’s App Store.\n\ngoProto is the first step in our larger strategy to change the way businesses are designed and created. With market validated concepts and an active community, we can go beyond testing ideas to funding them. The real future of the goProto platform is a micro-funding model that allows members to invest in projects directly, giving people the opportunity to vote with their dollars and make a return on their investment. goProto will be the goto place for investors and entrepreneurs looking for the next big thing.\n\nWe’re asking now for people to join us to push the new generation of open innovation and change how ideas are brought to life.
